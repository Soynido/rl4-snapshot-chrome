# RCEP™ Whitepaper (Draft)

**Title:** RCEP™ — Reasoning Context Encoding Protocol  
**Status:** Draft (research-grade documentation, evolving)  
**Scope:** Browser reference implementation + public protocol semantics  

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by limited context windows and lack durable, portable memory. Users repeatedly restate context when switching models, devices, or sessions. RCEP™ defines a **portable context package** that encodes a “cognitive state” (topics, decisions, timeline, integrity) in a deterministic JSON form that can be pasted across LLMs.

RCEP™ prioritizes:
- **Portability**: paste once, continue anywhere.
- **Determinism**: stable, predictable fields and canonicalization.
- **Integrity**: cryptographic checksum and optional device-only sealing.
- **Epistemic honesty**: explicit “unverified semantics” when transcript is omitted.

## Problem statement
Typical LLM sessions suffer from:
- **Amnesia**: model context resets between sessions/tools.
- **Lock-in**: context is trapped inside a vendor UI.
- **No audit trail**: “what was said” and “what was assumed” cannot be verified later.

RCEP™ addresses portability and integrity with a minimal, deterministic payload that survives copy/paste across systems.

## Design principles (normative intent)
- **Observed-or-Unknown**: if a fact is not present, it must not be invented.
- **Structure ≠ Truth**: structure can be preserved and sealed; correctness must remain explicit when unverified.
- **Local-first**: payload creation does not require a backend.
- **Human-readable first**: payloads should remain interpretable by humans (hence `_branding`).

## Threat model (high level)
RCEP™ payloads may be:
- truncated by context limits,
- edited (maliciously or accidentally),
- replayed out of context,
- generated by compromised clients.

Mitigations:
- **Checksum** detects any mutation relative to the canonicalized payload.
- **Integrity Seal (device-only)** binds payload integrity to a device-held signing key (WebCrypto non-exportable).

Non-goals (explicit):
- identity proof of a person (no notarization),
- resistance to a compromised device signing malicious content,
- semantic truth validation without transcript or external evidence.

## Protocol profiles
RCEP™ supports multiple “profiles” (payload shapes) that trade size vs fidelity.

- **Digest** (`RCEP_v1`): compact but semantically rich; transcript optional.
- **Ultra** (`RCEP_v2_Ultra`): aggressive size reduction; no transcript.
- **UltraPlus** (`RCEP_v2_UltraPlus`): Ultra + minimal semantic hints + epistemic flags.

## Integrity primitives
### Checksum
- **Algorithm**: SHA-256
- **Input**: canonicalized JSON (recursive key sorting)
- **Output**: 64-char lowercase hex

### Device-only Integrity Seal
