You are watching a video demonstration of the RL4 Snapshot Chrome Extension. Your task is to create professional English subtitles with accurate timestamps in SRT format.

CONTEXT: What is RL4 Snapshot?

RL4 Snapshot is a Chrome extension that solves a critical problem: portable context between Large Language Models (LLMs).

The Problem: When users switch between different LLM providers (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot), they lose context. They must repeatedly re-explain what they're working on, what decisions were made, what topics were discussed, and what timeline/phase they're in.

RL4 Snapshot captures this "cognitive state" and packages it into a portable format called RCEP™ (Reasoning Context Encoding Protocol).

How It Works: The extension generates a RCEP™ snapshot (JSON package) containing:
- Topics: What the conversation is about
- Decisions: What was chosen and why (as observable from the conversation)
- Timeline: Macro phases of the work
- Context summary: High-level overview
- Integrity: SHA-256 checksum + optional device-only signature seal
- Transcript (optional): Full conversation transcript for maximum fidelity

The 4-Step Workflow (Wizard UI):

1. Step 1: Generate Snapshot
   - User selects a mode:
     * Compact (recommended): Small, structured snapshot without transcript
     * Compact + Meaning (Ultra+): Adds tiny summary + checklist, no transcript
     * Full transcript: Best fidelity, includes full conversation transcript
   - User can optionally enable "Tamper Seal" (device-only integrity signature)
   - User clicks "Generate Snapshot"
   - Extension captures the conversation from the current LLM provider's UI

2. Step 2: Copy Finalization Prompt
   - Extension shows a "Copy finalization prompt" button
   - User copies a prompt that asks an LLM to compress the snapshot into "RL4 Blocks" (tagged blocks like <RL4-ARCH>, <RL4-LAYERS>, <RL4-TOPICS>, etc.)
   - Note: For Microsoft Copilot, the extension generates RL4 Blocks locally (bypassing Copilot's refusal of "protocol-like" prompts)

3. Step 3: Finalize Snapshot
   - User pastes the LLM response containing the RL4 Blocks into a textarea
   - User clicks "Finalize Snapshot"
   - Extension extracts the blocks, seals them, and stores them

4. Step 4: Copy Final Prompt
   - Extension shows a "Copy Final Prompt" button
   - User copies a prompt that includes the finalized RL4 Blocks
   - User pastes this into another LLM to resume the conversation with full context

Supported LLM Providers: Claude (claude.ai), ChatGPT (chatgpt.com, chat.openai.com), Gemini (gemini.google.com), Perplexity (perplexity.ai), Microsoft Copilot (copilot.microsoft.com)

Key Technical Concepts:
- RCEP™: The protocol format (JSON) that encodes portable context
- RL4 Blocks: A compressed, tagged format for final handoff between LLMs
- Checksum: SHA-256 hash of the canonicalized JSON (detects any edits)
- Integrity Seal: Optional ECDSA signature (device-only, offline) that binds the checksum to a device key
- Epistemic honesty: Ultra/UltraPlus profiles explicitly mark semantics as "unverified" when transcript is omitted

Why This Matters: No more context loss when switching LLMs, portable memory that survives sessions/devices/providers, integrity verification to detect edits or tampering, actionable handoff with RL4 Blocks that preserve direction, decisions, and next steps.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBTITLE GENERATION:

1. Watch the entire video carefully
2. Identify all spoken words, UI interactions, and key moments
3. Create subtitles in SRT format with:
   - Sequential subtitle numbers
   - Timestamps in format: HH:MM:SS,mmm --> HH:MM:SS,mmm
   - Accurate English transcription of all speech
   - Clear, concise text (max ~42 characters per line, 2 lines max per subtitle)
   - Natural pauses at sentence boundaries

4. Include context for UI actions:
   - When buttons are clicked (e.g., "Clicking Generate Snapshot")
   - When text is copied (e.g., "Copying finalization prompt to clipboard")
   - When options are selected (e.g., "Selecting Compact mode")
   - When metadata is shown (e.g., "Showing capture summary: 15 messages, 2.3x compression")

5. Use technical terms accurately:
   - "RCEP" (pronounced "R-C-E-P" or "recep")
   - "RL4" (pronounced "R-L-4")
   - "Snapshot" (not "screenshot")
   - "Checksum" (not "hash" in user-facing context)
   - "Integrity Seal" (when referring to the signature)

6. Maintain professional tone: Clear, concise, instructional

7. Timing precision:
   - Start timestamps should align with when speech begins
   - End timestamps should allow natural reading pace (typically 3-5 words per second)
   - Leave small gaps (0.2-0.5s) between subtitles for readability

8. Format example:
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome to RL4 Snapshot, a Chrome extension
that captures context from LLM conversations.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,200
Let me show you how to generate a snapshot
from a Claude conversation.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Provide the subtitles in SRT format (SubRip Text), ready to be saved as a .srt file.

BEGIN ANALYSIS: Please watch the video and generate the English subtitles with timestamps.
