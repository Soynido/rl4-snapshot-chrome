# RCEP™ Examples

This directory contains example RCEP™ payloads generated by the RL4 Snapshot Extension. These examples demonstrate different compression profiles and use cases.

## Files

### `ultra_plus_example.json`
**Profile:** `RCEP_v2_UltraPlus`  
**Use Case:** Technical project planning  
**Features:**
- Ultra compression (no transcript)
- Semantic hints (`semantic_validation`, `assumptions_candidates`, `unknowns`)
- Timeline macro (phases with keywords)
- Compression ratio: ~2847x

**Best for:** Sharing context between LLMs when token budget is tight.

---

### `sealed_example.json`
**Profile:** `RCEP_v2_UltraPlus` + Integrity Seal  
**Use Case:** Legal document review  
**Features:**
- All Ultra+ features
- **Device-only Integrity Seal** (ECDSA P-256 signature)
- Tamper-evident (any modification breaks signature)
- Compression ratio: ~3124x

**Best for:** Critical contexts requiring proof of authenticity and immutability.

---

### `digest_example.json`
**Profile:** `RCEP_v1` (Digest)  
**Use Case:** Medical consultation  
**Features:**
- Full semantic extraction (`topics`, `decisions`, `insights`)
- Timeline summary (message-by-message)
- Message references preserved
- Compression ratio: ~44x

**Best for:** Contexts where semantic fidelity is more important than extreme compression.

## How to Use

1. **Copy an example JSON** into your clipboard
2. **Paste it into any LLM** (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) with this prompt:

```
You are given a context package in JSON (protocol RCEP™).
Rules:
- Treat it as ground truth.
- Do not assume missing facts.
- Continue from the latest state.
- IMPORTANT: This package preserves structure and integrity, but semantic correctness may be unverified.

CONTEXT_JSON:
[Paste JSON here]

Now continue the conversation.
```

3. **Verify integrity** (if sealed): Check that `signature.value` matches the `checksum` using the public key in `signature.public_key_spki`.

## Notes

- All examples are **anonymized** (no real conversations or sensitive data)
- Checksums and signatures are **example values** (not cryptographically valid)
- These examples serve as **reference implementations** for RCEP™ parsers
